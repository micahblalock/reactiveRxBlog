You can build a single executable JAR file that contains all the necessary dependencies, classes, and resources. This makes it easy to ship, version, and deploy the service as an application throughout the development lifecycle, across different environments, and so forth.

gradle build

Then you can run the JAR file:

java -jar build/libs/rx-spring-boot-0.1.0.jar
